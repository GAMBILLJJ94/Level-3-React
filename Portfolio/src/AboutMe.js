        <p>
        Iâ€™ve been described as a relaxed personality person that can also switch into high gear when working on anything I put my mind to. After serving 6 years in the Navy I have also learned how to present myself, have attention for detail, but I also have the ability to work with anyone and accomplish any goal or task.
