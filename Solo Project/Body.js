                <p>A little about me, Iâ€™ve been described as a relaxed personality person that can also switch into high gear when working on anything I put my mind to. After serving 6 years in the Navy I have also learned how to present myself, have attention for detail, but I also have the ability to work with anyone and accomplish any goal or task. </p>
                <h1>Interests</h1>
                <p>With the passion I can bring to the workplace I can make anywhere I am at feel like a winning team. I also consider my work ethic and tenacity a contagious mindset that can help others to work hard toward any goal. </p>
            </div>
